        <font color="red" face="arial, helvetica">
            Google queries are simple yet powerful
        </font>
    </h2>

    To enter a query into Google,
    <b>
        <font color="#38A808">
            just type in a few descriptive keywords and hit "search."
        </font>
    </b>
    That's it! If you need them, however, we also provide a few advanced search
    operators.
    <ul>
        <li>
            <font color="red">
                <b>NEW!</b>
            </font>
            <b>
                <font color="#38A808" face="arial,helvetica">The "" operator.</font>
            </b>
            Google automatically prefers pages where the query terms are found in
            close proximity. However, sometimes the only relevant pages are those
            where some or all of the query words occur as a phrase. You can
            <b>
                <font color="#38A808"> enclose words in double-quotes </font>
            </b>
            <tt>("like this")</tt> to force the words to appear together in all
            returned documents.
        </li>
        <li>
            <font color="red">
                <b>NEW!</b>
            </font>
            <font color="#38A808" face="arial, helvetica">
                <b> The - operator. </b>
            </font>
            Sometimes it is helpful to choose words to exclude from a search. That
            is, you want all relevant result pages except those containing a certain
            word. We support this "not" functionality with the "-" operator. Simply
            <b>
                <font color="#38A808">prefix your query word with a</font>
            </b>
            - <tt>(-like -this)</tt> to make Google ignore all pages containing that
            word.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>
                <font color="#38A808" face="arial, helvetica">Automatic AND.</font>
            </b>
            Google only supports "and" queries. That is, it only returns pages that
            include all the query terms. The + operator, which enforces "and"
            behavior on some search engines, is unnecessary on Google (though it can
            be used to include stopwords; see below).
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>
        <font color="red" face="arial, helvetica">Do more than query</font>
    </h2>
    The results of a Google search do a lot to help point you toward the right
    result: the
    <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19990221212930if_/http://www.google.com/legend.html">numbers in the results</a>
    help you figure out result quality, and the query word-sensitive content
    helps you figure out what the pages are about.
    <br />
    <br />
    The results can also be used for further exploration of the web. Click on
    the bar graph at the beginning of the result, and see
    <b>
        <font color="#38A808">what pages link to this page.</font>
    </b>
    <br /><br />
    Click on the "cached" link, and see what the
    <b>
        <font color="#38A808">page looked like when we indexed it.</font>
    </b>
    Has the page changed so much it doesn't hold the information you need
    anymore? Perhaps the version in the cache will be more helpful.
    <h2>
        <font color="red" face="arial, helvetica">Feeling Lucky?</font>
    </h2>
    The "I feel lucky" button automatically takes you to the first web page
    returned for your query. When it works -- and it often works -- it means
    less time searching for web pages and more time looking at them.
    <br />
    <h2>
        <font color="red" face="arial, helvetica">Limitations on queries</font>
    </h2>
    Google does not support all of the operations found in all search engines.
    Many of these we plan on supporting in a future release.
    <br />
    <ul>
        <li>
            <b>
                <font color="#38A808" face="arial, helvetica">
                    No "or" operator.
                </font>
            </b>
            Most search engines will return pages that contain only some of the
            query terms, sometimes in preference to pages that contain all the
            terms! Google only returns pages that contain all the terms. There is no
            way to turn off this behavior. There is also no way to tell Google to
            accept pages containing either word A or word B. You must submit the
            query twice, once with word A and once with word B.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>
                <font color="#38A808" face="arial, helvetica">
                    Google doesn't "stem."
                </font>
            </b>
            Some search engines automatically expand your search, so when you type
            in "wood" it searches for "woods" as well, and maybe even "woody" or
            "wooden." There's some argument about whether this is good or bad, but
            Google does not support it. If in doubt, try both forms: "airline" and
            "airlines," for instance.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>
        <font color="red" face="arial, helvetica">Stopwords</font>
    </h2>
    Google removes common words such as "the" and "of" from the query before it
    starts to search. Use "+the" or "+of" to prevent the common word from being
    removed. This is sometimes helpful when the word is important for completing
    a phrase.
    <br /><br />
    Since some other search engines (but not Google) use "and" and "or" as
    search operators, Google ignores them. If you want to use "and" or "or" as
    actual query words, you can use "+and" or "+or".
    <br /><br />
    Note that you need to use "+" even within quotation marks. A query like
    "lord of the flies" will normally search for documents with "lord" and
    "flies" and any two words in between them. You can use "lord +of +the flies"
    to force those two words to be "of" and "the".
